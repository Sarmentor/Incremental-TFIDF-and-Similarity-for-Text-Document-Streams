# Incremental-TFIDF-and-Similarity-for-Text-Document-Streams
Incremental TFIDF and Similarity for Text Document Streams (with the use of Bipartite Graphs)

 - Inputs expected are .csv files with Doc ids and text fields
 - The similarity is incrementally updated only when needed and for the afected documents
 - ...similarly to the TF-IDF values
